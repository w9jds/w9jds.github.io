As a Le Champ I was given the privilege of getting to test out the Le 1 Pro early, and these are my impressions of the phone. Note, these are MY opinions, not LeEco's.

## Packaging
When you first get the Le Pro 1, it comes in a pretty sleek-looking black box. As you slide open the top you are greeted with the first view of the Le Pro 1. One of the things to most stand out, is that the phone is already sitting in a clear phone case. I must say that is a huge shocker and a very nice addition, especially since it doesn't seem to be the cheap kind of case. As you pull out the phone you will find the power brick and USB C cable in the bottom with an added bonus of a USB A to USB C adapter in their. It is kind of odd that the brick is separated into two different boxes but other than that, right away it seems you get a couple free additions that are pretty nice.

## Hardware

### Pros
The phone is all metal, which is nice and sturdy. The glass front has absolutely no bezel, and it sits nicely in the palm of your hand. The screen is REALLY nice, I mean competes with Samsung nice. I took a picture of the Galaxy S6 Edge and the Le 1 Pro next to each other and despite the Samsung having more saturated colors they are pretty comparable. Keep in mind, that you can change color vibrance and saturation on the Le 1 Pro, so if you like the saturated colors like on the Samsung you can turn those on. Here is the shot I took for comparison:

### Cons
The phone has built-in navigation bottoms in the bottom. The buttons are backwards so the back button is on the right. So your muscle reflexes will be all screwed up. There is the ability to turn on lefty mode, moving the back to the left again. However, the icon still stays a square so it is just confusing. These navigation buttons also have pretty dim lights on them, so it is hard to see unless the room is really dark. Somehow these dim lights actually bleed into the bottom of the screen when they are on, so that is also an issue.

I really love the premise of the mute switch, but it needs to work for it to actually be a nice feature.

The speakers are EXTREMELY loud, but all the sound is mono, out of one speaker, and degrades as you turn up the volume. On the other hand the sound quality from the headphone jack is pretty superb.

I talked about the glass going side to side. However, the screen has a small margin all the way around it making it seem as if there is no space between it and the sides, but to my dismay that isn't the case.

The phone seems to get very warm very easily, for instance just reading a magazine on Google Newstand tends to warm it up after a little while. Along those line, while you are holding it, your hand might get a little tired as well since it seems slightly heavier than what you are used to.

## Software
The Le 1 Pro is running a custom-built OS called EUI. This is more than an android skin, and quite frankly, greatly suffers because of it. 

### Pros
As far as I am concerned, there are no pros to the software on this device. Well, maybe the camera beautify option, but beyond that.

### Cons
To put it mildly, this is an extremely watered down version of Android, specifically designed to look and feel like iOS but remove some of the most import aspects of Android. As well as force you to use their stuff. I'll go over more specifics, but the best thing that could be done to make this phone better, is complete throw EUI to the curb. They should spend their time working on the Kernal to work with their hardware perks, make their proprietary apps, actual apps, and improve Android somehow. Not demolish it.

First is notifications. Notifications on this phone are useless. One of the best features of android is the fact that Notifications give you the ability to quickly see a good chunk of information, and then if you want act on it without even opening the application. They completely remove the ability to expand notifications, ignore any custom views apps use for notification, ignore any custom icons you use, and ignore the actions. Meaning you are looking at the least amount of information, you can't act on it, and there isn't really a point to having them. On top of this, they even override fonts, so if the app uses custom colors like slack where you get a mention, they forget to handle it so it is black text on a black background. It gets even worse, where they ignore layouts and force their own, using Google Music, the layout has no padding, no album art, and just looks plain awful in the drawer.

Now lets move to the notification drawer in general. This section suffered greatly as well. Quick action and settings where completely removed. Meaning you can't get time, date, current user, bluetooth, etc. You can't even open the settings from the navigation drawer anymore. With this and the notification, I don't think there is really a point to have them in EUI it is so bad.

Lets take a look at the issues on the lock screen. First of all, the lock screen can't be overridden. You want to use one of those awesome, way more functional lock screens on the play store? Too bad! You install the app, you have to unlock your phone twice. Next, only time you get a notification on it, is when you have one randomly important one. And if you hold your finger on it, it shows chinese under it. No matter what language you have set for the phone. You can't even change songs from your lock screen, you have to unlock the phone or swipe from the top to do so.

Lets take a look at the skinning system. They decided to force a theme on you, so that includes icons. Now these icons don't actually check package names it seems, so when you go to install the real Google Clocks app or Google Camera application it renames it to the same things as LeEco's apps and shows the same icon.

One of the really nice thing about Android is now you can disable any apps you want that are required by the system and should be able to remove anything that isn't. Well, they decided to override this too. You can't disable or uninstall any of their applications, so they are trying to pull a Samsung, where they remove as much Google as possible and force their own stuff on you instead. No matter how bad an alternative it is. Along with that, they don't even update via a Play Store. They all require you to open them and then update from inside of them.

This is far from the last issue, but this is the last one I'll cover. The English support isn't that great. There are huge sections like complete settings forms that are still sitting in chinese along with the lock screen and notification chinese that randomly pops up.

## Overview
I actually wouldn't recommend this phone to anyone. I would recommend an iPhone over this phone, and if you know me, that is saying A LOT.
